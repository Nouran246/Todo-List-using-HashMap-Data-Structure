## Todo-List-using-HashMap-Data-Structure
The To-Do List application is built using C++ and Qt Creator. It leverages the HashMap data structure to efficiently manage tasks with priority. The application supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), enabling users to add, view, modify, or remove tasks. Additionally, it incorporates a search functionality for locating tasks quickly by name or description. The app also handles file operations to persist the to-do list across sessions, storing tasks in a file format that can be loaded and saved as needed.
